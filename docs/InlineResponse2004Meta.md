**prereservation_id** | **str** | The pre-reservation ID generated by this availability check. If present, this will be passed into the reserve call. It will override the pre-reservation ID passed in the request, so if this value is different from the one passed in the request this value will be used in the reserve call. If using Base64 to encode a value for the pre-reservation ID, it is strongly advised to use URL safe Base64 encoding without padding.  | [optional]
